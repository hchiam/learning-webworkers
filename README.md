WebWorkers are available even in IE 10.

You can use WebWorkers to free up the main thread and UI, and help apps work faster on low-end devices.

And you can make WebWorkers easier to use from the main thread by using [`comlink`](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink) instead of trying to manage WebWorker messaging (since WebWorkers can't directly access things like the DOM).
